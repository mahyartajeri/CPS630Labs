Welcome to our website

To run our website do the following steps

1. Move this folder to the 'htdocs' folder in the XAMPP folder.
1. Startup Apache and Mysql in XAMPP.
2. Create a database in phpmyadmin called 'cps630'
3. Copy and paste all sql code from 'PrepareDB.sql' to the 'cps630' database in phpmyadmin and run it. This should create all necessary tables and an admin user.
4. Use the website!

NOTE:

You must begin on the main.php page of the website for spa to work.
For example, the link below is the path of the project in htdocs and ends with main.php
http://localhost/CPS630Labs/Project/Iter3&4/main.php

To use the admin login for db maintain controls use the following account
user: admin
pass: admin123
